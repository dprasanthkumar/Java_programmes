NOTE:
	>String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
	>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
	>float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
	>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
	>boolean - stores values with two states: true or false
	
	
int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
String myText = "Hello";     // String

Primitive Data Types
A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:

Data Type	Size			Description
byte		1 byte			Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short		2 bytes			Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	    4 bytes			Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long		8 bytes			Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float		4 bytes			Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double		8 bytes			Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean	1 bit			Stores true or false values
char		2 bytes			Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
